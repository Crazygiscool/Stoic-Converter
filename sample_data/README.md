# README for Sample Data

This directory contains sample data used for testing the Stoic Journal Converter. The sample data includes example stoic journal entries that can be parsed and converted into Obsidian notes.

## Sample Data Format

The sample journal entries are formatted in a way that mimics the structure of actual stoic journals. Each entry includes a title, content, and date, allowing for comprehensive testing of the converter's parsing and formatting capabilities.

## Usage

To use the sample data, simply reference the files in this directory when running tests or during development. Ensure that the converter is set up to read from this directory to access the sample entries.

## Contribution

If you have additional sample data or improvements to the existing samples, feel free to contribute by adding new files or modifying the existing ones.
